Current Apps:
Google Sheets
Hevy, Strong, etc.
Main problems with current solutions:
The paywall - monthly subscriptions, requiring higher, more exp subs for extra features
Google Sheets is clunky
Solution: Make an open-source app to track weightlifting
Features/Problems:
PRIORITY - Exercise Diary: Log exercises, weight lifted, #sets, #reps, rest times, notes, etc. for each exercise
Create input boxes for each column
Dropdown menu for each exercise
Create an “Add Exercise button”
Track PRs (Highest weight => Highest # of reps as TB)
Progress Visualizer: Visualize progress for certain exercises
Basic Line graph (Time vs Highest weight lifted)
Workout Planner: Plan workout splits for the week
Exercise Tutorial Search: Get tutorials for how to perform certain exercises
Video Search (From YT?) - might be a copyright strike tho
LLM Summary?
How to track drop sets??? Unilateral exercises???
Tech Stack…
MERN???
Database: MongoDB or SQL?
Backend
Frontend: React
Typescript vs Javascript
Typescript is a superset of Javascript
Typescript is OOP, JS is Prototype
Typescript harder to learn but better for error checks (catches errors at compiler time)
Can just convert JS to TS at a later time
